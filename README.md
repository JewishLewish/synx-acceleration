# Synx
Acceleration Plugin for Small MC Servers written in Java!

## Optimisation Tools
``File Optimisation`` -> When Acceleration is placed to 'fast,' it will optimise the files of spigot, bukkit and paper to make it run more fast.

``Minechart Chest Deletion`` -> Will delete Minechart Chests in order to remove unncessarily entities. 

``Texture Pack`` -> Uses barebones texture pack for server's that already doesn't use a texture pack. User's have option to use it FPS boost. 

## Lag Machine Combatter

``Snowman Nerf`` -> Disables the A.I. of Snowman so their entity ticks (and snowballs) won't affect the server. 

## Future Plans

``Armor Stand Management`` -> Removal of 'moving' armor stands ticks to counter lag .

``Mob Merge`` -> Making mobs merge.

``Emergency Mode`` -> Several Changes to files so it can handle severe bad TPS attacks .

## How to use it?
1) Put the plugin's jar file into the plugins folder.
2) Boot the server so the plugin can give it's config file from there.
3) Edit the server's config file to the options you want. (for acceleration, change it to 'fast')
4) Reload the server and the plugin will take it's affect.
