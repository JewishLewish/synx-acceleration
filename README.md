# Synx
Acceleration Plugin for Small MC Servers written in Java!

## Optimisation Tools
``File Optimisation`` -> When Acceleration is placed to 'fast,' it will optimise the files of spigot, bukkit and paper to make it run more fast.

``Minechart Chest Deletion`` -> Will delete Minechart Chests in order to remove unncessarily entities. 

``Texture Pack`` -> Uses barebones texture pack for server's that already doesn't use a texture pack. User's have option to use it FPS boost. 

``Smarter Redstone`` -> (For Paper Servers) Uses a more efficient redstone method

### Server Properties Editing
``View Distance`` -> Adjust the server's view distance so users can load in less chunks

``Simulation Distance`` -> Adjust the server's simulation distance so the server can run ticks at a lower chunk distance

### Lag Machine Combatter

``Snowman Nerf`` -> Disables the A.I. of Snowman so their entity ticks (and snowballs) won't affect the server.
